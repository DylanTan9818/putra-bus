## Installation

Clone repository via HTTPs

```git
git clone https://github.com/aqilsyamil/putra-bus.git
```

You need to install dependencies for the project. Dependencies is install by using a dependencies manager. We use bun and npm as our dependencies manager. You can install both bun and `npm` by refering to [our package manager installation section](#installing-package-manager).

After all mobile app environments has been install, open the repository or project in your local machine and run the following script in your CLI.

```bash
bun run install:dependencies:project
```

To update existing dependencies, run the following.

```bash
bun run update:depencies:project
```

### Installing Package Manager

#### Bun

To install Bun on macOS, Linux, or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), execute the following curl command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

For installing a specific version, use:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash -s "bun-v1.0.0"
```

Ensure that your Linux system has the unzip package installed, and it's recommended to have a kernel version of 5.6 or higher. To check the kernel version, use uname -r.

For Windows installation, ensure you have at least Windows 10 version 1809 and run the following PowerShell command:

```bash
powershell -c "irm bun.sh/install.ps1|iex"
```

Bun can also be installed via npm, Homebrew, Docker, or Scoop package managers. For further installation refer to [Bun official documentation](https://bun.sh/docs/installation).

#### Node & `npm`

For installing Node.js and npm, utilize a Node version manager like `nvm` for managing multiple Node.js versions or use a Node installer if a version manager isn't feasible. To download the LTS version from the Node.js download page for macOS or Windows, and for Linux, consider using the NodeSource installer. For more instructions, refer to [this Node and `npm` installation guide](https://kinsta.com/blog/how-to-install-node-js/).
